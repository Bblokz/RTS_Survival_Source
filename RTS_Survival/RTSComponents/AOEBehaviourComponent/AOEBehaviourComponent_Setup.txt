AOE Behaviour Component Setup (Blueprint)
=======================================

Purpose
-------
Use the AOEBehaviourComponent to periodically apply Behaviour Components to nearby units.
It performs async sphere sweeps and applies or removes behaviours as actors enter or leave
range, optionally spawning animated combat text.

Blueprint Setup Checklist
-------------------------
1) Add the component
   - In your Blueprint Actor, add the "AOE Behaviour Component".

2) Provide an RTS component on the same actor
   - Ensure the owning actor has an RTSComponent attached (the AOE component validates this
     on BeginPlay and uses it to resolve player ownership / team logic).

3) Configure the Settings struct (AOE Behaviour category)
   - Interval Seconds
     * How often the async sweep runs. Must be > 0.
     * Lower values update more frequently but cost more CPU.
   - Radius
     * Sweep radius in Unreal units (centimeters). Must be > 0 and above the minimum async
       sweep radius.
   - Behaviour Types
     * List of behaviour classes to apply to valid targets in range. Must contain at least
       one entry.
   - Text Settings (Animated Text)
     * Text Class: The widget class used to display floating text.
     * Text Material: Optional material override for the widget.
     * Text Offset: World offset applied when spawning the text (Z default is 100).
     * In Wrap At: Text wrap width for the widget.
     * Text Color: The color used for the animated text.

4) Optional: Control runtime enable/disable
   - Call SetAOEEnabled(true/false) from Blueprint to start or stop periodic checks.
   - When disabled, the timer is cleared and existing applied behaviours are removed.

5) Optional: Custom overlap logic
   - Overlap logic is resolved from the owning actor (e.g., friend/enemy rules). Make sure
     the owning actor is set up with the correct team/affiliation data to filter targets.

Notes
-----
- IntervalSeconds and Radius are validated on BeginPlay. If invalid, the component logs
  an error and does not start ticking.
- The component uses async sphere sweeps, so it is safe to run on frequent intervals.
- For animated text, ensure your project has a valid widget class and any pooled text
  manager needed by your UI setup.
