setting: east germany.
hills; factory with many unmanned nearly vehicles parked around;
layers of trenches around the factory to defend it from all sides.
one side has a bridge. one side is a hilly scorched landscape.

the player needs to divide infantry between manning the trenches and capturing defenses and using scavengers to repair-capture the vehicles.
there is a small area for a base where also radixite and metal can be harvested.

the player must make sure the factory survives the soviet assault.

all marders or stugs (depending on what the player picked) are available for capture from the start of the mission.
in the beginning mostly light infantry and mechanized units will attack the player.
later large formations of t-34s and kvs will appear.

in the beginning some resistance infantry (kar +MG34) will be in trenches and the player has access to scavengers to repair vehicles
defenses help support the other infantry.

how the defense looks like now:
north: 2 bridges.
east: small ramp towards factory (factory is on the hill)  that connects with the landslide from the bridges that continues south.
south large ramp with many trenches to defend the largest waves.
west: build area; base start with harvesters and resources.
middle/top hill: factory with marders or stugs to capture.
