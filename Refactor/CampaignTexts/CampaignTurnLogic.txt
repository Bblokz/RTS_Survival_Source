Parts of turn for player:

*** chapters ***
Chapter 1: at the edge of the fow show the russian wall, behind that are the important cities.

Chapter2: attack waves start from the wall.

Chapter3: break through the wall
*********************************************

*** Large world map objects, points of interest.
Visible through the fow ***

-The east wall 🧱 : unlocks chapter.
-water Dam: several points along river; one is chosen. Has a special break the dam mission.
Will destroy 2 map items downstream.

- radixite ground zero ☢️: heavy radiation zones where some vehicles are not available.

- The black forrest🌲: too dense for vehicles to pass. An infantry and light mechanized troups only mission.


Make sure there is a turn counter:
- to keep track of how long events last
- One mission is one turn

Player Profile:
-Gain cards from missions
-Gain cards from winning events
-Gain commander experience from missions

The profile will still be saved in the different file like now, do need new UI for selecting profile cards.

Commander experience:
- unlock more starting units and resources slots
- unlock extra slots on the factories.
Card slots will start with costing one perk
But as the player unlocks more they get more expensive to prevent focussing too much on one type-

--------- General work flow for adjusting the world map --------------------
need some spline based overlay that shows what the area of the soviet influence is.
AAnchorPoints; General world map point; the campaign will be generated by promoting these points to 
either mission points, enemy map items, player map items. or neutral items.

sight of items: neutral items should always be visible.
other items: if not a player item; then only visible if 2 away from a player item in the graph.

campaign generation depends on campaignGenerationSettings which will contain the difficulty percentage.
and a seed.
and later other settings.
the campaign generation needs to be an editor callable function so the designer can see how a generation will play out

in the RTS_Survival folder add a new folder called WorldCampaign.
in there add a folder called WorldMapObjects
In there add a folder called AnchorPoint
and a folder Connection

in both respectively you will create the new aactor derived classes AAnchorPoint and AConnection.

under WorldCampaign also add a folder called CampaignGeneration in there add a folder called GeneratorWorldCampaign. where the new actor derived AGeneratorWorldCampaign will be placed.



----------- PSEUDO CODE --------------
First make sure all UI Objects are created correctly to make sure it is clear what data needs to be handled in the backend

WorldPlayerController : CardPlayerController.

Post init:
-load world UI from class (hardref)
-PlayerProfileLoader async load profile.
-init player commander levels and perks.
-load map setup:
