Location:
Bohemian forest. Czech republic

1. Destroy nearby anti-air defenses


2. Call in Ju 87 Stuka strikes to break forward Russian defenses


3. Seize the radar base + hangar (unlock ME 410)


4. Build air-support infrastructure


5. Use ME 410 aircraft to destroy 2–3 fortified Russian bases


6. Win by wiping out all remaining armored forces in the region

Phase 1 – Clear the Skies

Goal: Destroy enemy anti-air installations (AA cannons, old SAMs)
Mechanics:

Spread-out AA gun positions around hills and forest clearings

Each AA site is guarded by infantry and light armor

Optional: use stealth or multiple flanks to approach them


Why:
This opens the skies and enables Stuka airstrikes later in the mission


---

🔸 Phase 2 – Call the Bombers

Goal: Use existing Ju 87 Stukas to break entrenched Russian defenses guarding the radar base
Mechanics:

Player calls in targeted dive bombings on bunkers, pillboxes, and trenches

These defenses are too costly to take head-on otherwise

You must place observers or advance close enough to mark targets


Outcome:
With defenses broken, the path to the radar base opens


---

🔸 Phase 3 – Seize the Radar and Hangar Complex

Goal: Capture the old radar complex and overgrown hangar
Gameplay:

Light skirmish at the radar station

Hangar is intact but locked — engineers needed to cut into it

ME 410 prototype and damaged units found inside


Outcome:

ME 410 is unlocked for production

Hangar becomes available for air unit deployment



---

🔸 Phase 4 – Establish Your Air Base

Goal: Build support structures to produce and maintain ME 410 aircraft
Mechanics:

Radar Control Tower (must be online for target designation)

Airstrip expansion (possibly limited to 2–3 aircraft max at once for balance)

Aircraft must refuel and rearm at the base


Bonus:

Optional upgrade to radar allows longer-range strikes or stealth recon



---

🔸 Phase 5 – Seek and Destroy

Goal: Destroy the heavily defended Russian bases nearby
Setup:

At least 2 fortified bases, each with different threats:

1. Tank Depot – heavy armor, fuel depots (good CAS targets)


2. Artillery Nest – long-range fire support, vulnerable to bombing


3. (Optional) Command Post – well-defended, but gives tech blueprints if captured




Gameplay:

Player uses ME 410s to weaken defenses before ground assault

Combined arms encouraged (air + infantry + light armor)



---

🔸 Phase 6 – Victory

Goal: Destroy all Russian military presence in the region
Trigger: All bases destroyed OR command center neutralized
