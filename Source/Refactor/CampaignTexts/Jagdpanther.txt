---- Setting: ----
Golden-brown fields stretch out beneath overcast skies, stalks of dead grain swaying in dry wind.

Abandoned villages with collapsed red-brick homes and overgrown dirt roads.

Cracked bunkers and shattered concrete lie half-buried in tall yellowing grass.

Rusting German vehicles and burned-out CRD armor dot the hillsides.

Leafless trees and blackened forests, scorched during earlier fighting.

Rail lines twisted like scars, with shattered freight cars frozen in time.

Orange fog and dust from distant bombardments hang low in the valleys.

Buzzing insects and the sound of creaking metal replace signs of life.

Crows circle silently overhead, perching on rusted radio towers and pillboxes.

Long shadows stretch over earthworks, broken fences, and the cracked husks of silos.

---- END SETTING----

Phase1: repair old base and recover jagdpanthers.
Limited resources to train extra Scavs: choose between repairing bunkers or jagdpanthers (after they are recovered they are not full health)

🔧 Jagdpanther 1 and 2 – Workshop Lockdown

Located in a sealed underground repair bay.

The player must restore power to the bay via an old fuel generator.

After power-up, automated bay doors rise, and engineers begin the recovery process.

Enemy scouting squads will try to interrupt the process—defend until complete.

🔧 Jagdpanther 3 – Submerged in Rubble

Buried beneath a collapsed ammunition warehouse on the edge of the base.
Use harvesters to extract.

Phase 2: defend against increasing amounts of enemy waves.

Phase 3: final wave: heavy tanks.

****** BONUS OBJECTIVE ******
Repair 3 bunkers for construction blueprints.
Recover the Stugs (3) at a nearby field to gain tank blueprints.
