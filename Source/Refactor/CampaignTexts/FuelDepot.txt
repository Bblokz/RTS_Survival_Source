📍 Mission: Black Gold Burnout
New unit: flame troopers.

Location: Ploiești, Romania — heavily industrial oil zone, shattered infrastructure, CRD defenses.
Objective: Completely destroy the Ploiești fuel depot to cripple Russian operations in southern Europe.

🏕️ Player Landing Zone (SW of Map)

Sheltered in a dry canal bed surrounded by rusted pumping equipment and burnt trees.

Mobile HQ deploys here.

Terrain provides natural chokepoints for defense.


🪨 Nearby Resources:

Radixite Field: Just west of the starting area, among broken storage tanks and a collapsed derrick. Mid-risk — occasionally patrolled by a light CRD scout car.

Metal Cache: Southeast of the player’s landing zone, in the remains of a scrapped refinery. Guarded by a few CRD conscripts and a static MG nest.

Vehicle Parts: Scattered across an abandoned repair yard to the northeast, near a shattered pipeline. The yard is occupied by light Russian vehicles — a good early raid opportunity.


Phase 1: Controlled Sabotage

Objective: Destroy 4 critical pipeline valve structures to start a cascading fuel fire.

Pipelines are spread across a grid of shattered industrial blocks.

Phase 2: Timed Destruction

Objective: Destroy a central pressure regulation tower within 8 minutes of the last pipe sabotage.

The tower is located on a hill overlooking the depot, guarded by garrisoned buildings, AA guns, and a small tank platoon.

The timer starts as soon as the fourth pipe is destroyed.

If the timer runs out, the tower overloads and disperses pressure across auxiliary systems

Phase 3: Main Depot Annihilation

Objective: Destroy the central fuel depot complex.

Surrounded by concrete walls, flame towers, and defensive emplacements.

The player must either go for a frontal breach or exploit one of the destroyed pipeline tunnels as an alternate route.
