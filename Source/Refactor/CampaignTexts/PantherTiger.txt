%%%%%%% SETTING %%%%%%%
Post-Apocalyptic Hungarian Battlefield – Autumn Setting

Wide, flat plains with scorched soil and wind-swept golden grass stretching to the horizon.

Charred hulls of destroyed tanks, half-sunk in mud and rust, litter the open fields.

Crumbling farmhouses and grain silos turned to strongpoints, now abandoned and pockmarked by shell fire.

Overgrown trenches and anti-tank ditches, remnants of a long-past armored clash.

Sun-bleached signs in Hungarian and German, barely legible among the dust.

A toppled observation tower, its rusting frame jutting out of a cratered ridge.

Blackened tree stumps and dry hedgerows offering minimal cover.

Scattered tank parts and scorched treads visible where battles raged and machines died.

Crows and carrion birds picking at old wreckage, circling silently above.

Red-orange twilight filtering through drifting smoke, casting long shadows across a battlefield frozen in ruin.
