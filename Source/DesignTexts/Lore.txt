2 Lore Introduction

In the waning months of the Second World War, a desperate race to harness the destruc-
tive might of atomic energy forever altered the course of human history. In September of
1944, a few days after the first successful V2 rocket attacks from Germany against London
Soviet spies successfully infiltrated Germany’s V2 rocket program, capturing intelligence
and technological blueprints.
With this stolen knowledge, Soviet engineers developed an intercontinental ballistic mis-
sile capable of delivering payloads across vast distances. While in complete secrecy, Soviet
scientists were at that time nearly completed with their atomic weapon program, ultima-
tely mounting these onto their adapted V2 rockets. Meanwhile, the Western Allies and
Germans frantically pursued their atomic programs but failed to complete their develop-
ments in time.
This technological edge made the war decisively one-sided. Only the Soviet Union suc-
cessfully developed nuclear weapons, which they first unleashed against Germany.
Following this Soviets declared war on Japan in August 1945, invading Japanese-held
territories in Manchuria and northern China. Escalating hostilities between the two po-
wers intensified after Japan refused unconditional surrender, mobilising defensive efforts
and initiating preemptive strikes against Soviet positions in East Asia. In response, Sta-
lin authorised the use of nuclear weapons against Japan, devastating major cities and
military installations, effectively ending Japanese resistance and completing Soviet domi-
nance across Eurasia.
Determined to end the war swiftly and decisively, Soviet leadership saw the Axis po-
wers’ defeat as merely the first step toward establishing global dominance. As mistrust
and ideological tensions escalated rapidly between the Soviet Union and Western Allies,
the Soviets preemptively struck the American and British and French forces to elimi-
nate potential future threats. What followed was massive devastation—cities reduced to
rubble, armies annihilated, and humanity plunged into a catastrophic state.

2.1 Radixite Birth

The Soviets failed to anticipate the catastrophic environmental repercussions of their
nuclear bombardments. The detonations released enormous amounts of radioactive ma-
terial into the atmosphere, reducing sunlight and initially leading scientists to predict a
nuclear winter. Yet, something unexpected occurred—the nuclear detonations and sub-
sequent radiation created unique geological and atmospheric conditions that birthed a
new crystalline substance: Radixite. These luminous crystals released heat and energy,
counteracting the cooling effects scientists had anticipated. Instead of plunging into a
prolonged winter, the Earth’s climate warmed dramatically, transforming landscapes into
barren, Mars-like deserts perpetually engulfed by intense dust storms. Radixite became
the catalyst for this radical and enduring climatic shift.

2.2 How Sovjet Russia became a main power

The Russians fared relatively well, primarily due to their distance from the blasts and
their vast, sparsely populated territories and extensive underground bunkers, initially con-
structed to withstand conventional warfare. These isolated facilities, many deep within
Siberia and other remote regions, shielded significant numbers of their population and
military infrastructure from direct nuclear impacts.

2.3 How Nomads Emerged

Decades later, the survivors emerged into a transformed world. Civilization as it once was
lay in ruin; remnants of former greatness—twisted, rusted steel skeletons of buildings,
scattered vehicle parts, and World War II artefacts—were strewn across the wasteland.
Amidst these radiant ruins, factions began to form anew, driven by the desperate need
to control precious resources.
The Russians, having weathered the storm better than most, consolidated power within
formidable, concrete-reinforced bases. They leveraged their surviving technology and su-
perior numbers, becoming the dominant force in this harsh new world. With no central
authority left standing, scattered groups of German and Western Allies survivors adap-
ted to nomadic lifestyles, scavenging for essential resources—particularly the valuable
Radixite crystals.
Now, the world is on the brink of a renewed conflict. The Russian leadership, aware
of the destabilising effects of nuclear weaponry, prefers to rely on conventional military
might to maintain control. Fearful of causing further environmental catastrophe, they
refrain from deploying nuclear arsenals—at least for now.

characters:
🔶 1. The Hazmat Trooper — “The Canary”

Role: Early-game presence, frontline scout, first taste of Soviet power.
Personality: Loyal but shaken; indoctrinated but still human.

Backstory
Originally a cleanup soldier assigned to Radixite extraction sites.
Saw entire units collapse from exposure; his suit is both his armor and his prison.
Taught to fear the outside world more than the Soviets themselves.
Believes deeply that he’s serving “the last real government on Earth.”

Traits

Cautious, paranoid, always scanning the horizon.
Constantly checking his suit seals, muttering radiation readings under his breath.
Obeys orders instantly — fear of punishment is immense.

Narrative Purpose
Introduces players to the aesthetic and danger of Soviet-controlled zones.
Provides small hints that the Soviets are hiding something massive:
“Strange readings again… probably just those… machines they’re building.”

🔶 2. The Cyborg Soldier — “Unit-7 / The Iron Warden”

Role: Mid-game antagonist, symbol of Soviet transhumanism.
Personality: Cold, mission-focused, stripped of identity.

Backstory
Former elite soldier who volunteered (or was coerced) into the Soviet cybernetics program.
His limbs and organs were replaced after Radixite exposure nearly killed him.
Now controlled by a neural inhibitor — but fragments of his old self sometimes leak through.

Traits
Precise movements, unnatural posture.
Voice has slight metallic distortion.
Sometimes hesitates when facing civilians or resistance fighters — memory echoes.

Narrative Seeds
He references Projekt 24 without naming it:
“Our enhancements are nothing compared to what comes next.”
“The Commander says the machines will make us obsolete. I hope that is true.”

Purpose
Represents the moral decay of Soviet experimentation.
Builds tension toward the bigger reveal of Projekt 24.

🔶 3. The Cortex Commander — “Marshal Korovin”

Role: Main antagonist, leader of the Soviet Remnant.
Personality: Calculated, authoritarian, visionary but blinded by ideology.

Backstory
One of the original Soviet military scientists.
Exposed to radiation early in the war—saved by experimental cybernetic implants.
His enhanced cortex allows him to process battlefield data in real time.
Believes the Soviets saved the world by being the only surviving organized nation.
Sees all nomads as destabilizing threats.

Traits
Calm, unnervingly confident.
Speaks slowly but with absolute authority.
Half his skull is reinforced plate; cybernetic eye tracks everything.

Motivation
He believes in a future where humanity survives through order and machinery, not chaos.
Link to Projekt 24
He authorized it.

One of his lines foreshadows it:
“Steel does not tire. Steel does not doubt. Steel will rebuild what flesh destroyed.”
“When Projekt 24 marches… balance will return to the world.”
