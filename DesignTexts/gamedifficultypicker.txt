 you will have to  create a nw widget under GameUI and then GameDifficultyPicker as its dir.
 this uuser derived widget will have: (all bind widget)
 a button for new to rts difficulty
 a button for normal difficulty
    a button for hard difficulty
    a button for brutal difficulty
    a button for ironman difficulty

it will also have a border called DifficultyInfoBorder by initialization set it hidden.
make sure the difficulty border is shown whenever we hover on of the buttons and call a blueprint implementable event
 called BP_OnDifficultyHovered with a parameter of the difficulty type hovered. this difficulty type you get from  ERTSGameDifficulty
 as found in GameDifficulty.h
 
 in addition you need to implement the dev settings found in RTSGameDifficultySettings.h so that that settings page will have
 a tmap from the ERTSGameDifficulty to int32 that will get the percentage per difficulty level. also set the CategoryName to Game and set the section name to 
 RTS Difficulty Settings
 
 make sure the border of the info is hidden when no button is hovered.
 
 okay so when a button in the widget is clicked get those settings and find the integer for percentage. if not found
 do an RTSFunc lib ReportError.
 then call an other func on the widget called OnDifficultyChosen with the int32 percentage and the ERTSGameDifficulty chosen.
 and in there use the FRTS_Statics::GetGameMissionManager and set the difficulty using 	void SetMissionDifficulty(const int32 NewDifficultyPercentage, const ERTSGameDifficulty GameDifficulty);
 on it. after that remove this widget from the viewport and destroy it.
 
 in addition add a editanywhere property bool to the mission manager that will be called bSetGameDifficultyWithWidget.
 also add a protected field; edit defaults only and bp readwrite of subclass of our new widget.
 
 at begin play before activate new mission on all the configured mission call a private that checks if this bool is set; 
 if so then create the widget with a high z order and add to viewport.
