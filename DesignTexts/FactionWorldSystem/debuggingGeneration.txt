can you write a prompt for codex to add various debugging using the 	static void DrawDebugAtLocation(
		const UObject* WorldContext,
		const FVector& Location,
		const FString& Text,
		FColor Color = FColor::White,
		float Duration = 5.0f);

Froim the class RTS_SURVIVAL_API RTSFunctionLibrary
Here is how i want it organized:
a special UWorldCampaignDebugger derived from actor component that is expected to be added on the bp instance of the world generator *not added as subobject* as that leads to me not being able to change the edit anywhere settings on that component.
this componennt will be found at post init of the world generator and if not do report error.

with settings that are exposed as editanywhere:
float DefaultDebugHeightOffset = 300 
float AddedHeightIfStillDisplaying = 200
DisplayTimeRejectedLocation = 3 // for any debug above an achorpoint that was rejected for placement
DisplayTimeAcceptedLocation = 5 // for any debug above an anchorpoint that was accepted for placement

bool bDebugAnchorDegree = false whether to display the degree of the anchor of the selected anchor for placement for this object IF the rules for the placement of it did care about that.
bool bDebugPlayerHQHops = false whether to display the hops from the player HQ if the placement of this object cared about it.
bool bDebugEnemyHQHops = false Whether to display the hops from the enemy HQ if the placement of this object cared about it.
bool bDisplayVariationEnemyObjectPlacement = true whether to show a debug print with variation and the variation index/number when we use a variation of placement rules for this particular object (this will be displayed on the successfull placement of that enemy object)
bool bDisplayHopsFromSameEnemyItems = true whether to display the hops from enemy items that are of the same item after the succesfull placement.
bool bDisplayHopsFromOtherNeutralItems = true whether to display the hops from other neutral items after a neutral item was succesfully placed.

bool bDebugFailedMissionPlacement = false whether to display debug info when a mission placement fails; if set to true also display
what caused the failure (make it concise!)
bool bDisplayHopsFromHQForMissions = true whether to display the hops from the HQ on succesfull mission placement.
bool bDebugMissionSpacingHops = true whether to display the hops from other missions on succesfull mission placement (only show
if the mission rules for  the placement of this mision cared about that spacing)
bool bDisplayMinMaxConnectionsForMissionPlacement = true whether to display the min/max connection counts for mission placement on succesfull placement.
b DisplayMissionAdjacencyRequirements = true whether to display adjacency requirements for mission placement on succesfull placement.
bool bDisplayNeutralItemRequirementForMission = true if the mission needed to be placed on top of a neutral item, display that requirement on succesfull placement.


How this component needs to work: it needs to keep track for each aanchor it has debugged for how long ago that was (keep track of time stamps)
so that if the same anchor is debugged again within the added height time it will add the added height offset to the debug height so messages never overlap!
make sure all data on this component of debugging is wiped when the designer elects to clear all the generation data on the world generator!

provide the full prompt for codex to implement this and make sure codex moves any previous debugging of in world strings on 
aanchor points to the responsibility of this component.
Finally; make sure codex implements it in such a way that there is no extra CPU overhead when

		constexpr bool GCampaignBacktracking_Compile_DebugSymbols is set to false.
		
		provide the full prompt
