faction decision -> launch campaign generation -> creates W_FactionDifficultySelector (overwrites OnDifficultyChosen)

we need to refactor void UW_FactionSelectionMenu::LaunchCampaign().


 you need to define new widgets for the faction system and make sure to hook up the settings chosen by the user to the game instance.
 you will also need to refactor some functions in the faction system that deal with the LaunchCampaign.
first define the UW_FactionDifficultyPicker that is derived from UW_GameDifficultyPicker make sure that the void UW_GameDifficultyPicker::OnDifficultyChosen(const int32 DifficultyPercentage, const ERTSGameDifficulty SelectedDifficulty)
is changed  to virtual and overwritten in the UW_FactionDifficultyPicker.
Make sure that the void UW_FactionSelectionMenu::LaunchCampaign() is rerouted to the AFactionPlayerController and make sure the
AFactionPlayerController will have hte protected
	UPROPERTY(EditDefaultsOnly, Category = "Faction Selection")
	TSoftObjectPtr<UWorld> M_CampaignWorld;
while that will be removed form the UW_FactionSelectionMenu.

make sure the faction selection menu has a ERTSFaction private that will be set to the right faction when the button associated with that faction is pressed.
( the break through faction by default as we start with that one selected automatically)
make sure that this selected faction enum is provided through the launch campaign button to the AFactionPlayerController and that the controller
stores it.

when we are at the launch campaign in the faction controller we first do a few other things before loading the map.
0. store the faction selected.
1. remove our faction selection menu.
2. make sure there is a defaults setting for the derived class of UW_FactionDifficultyPicker and now that the faction menu
is gone add that one to the view port. Make sure the UW_FactionDifficultyPicker gets a poitner to this controller to call back on when the player has
selected their difficulty.
now we wait till the player has selected.

3. once the player has selected the difficulty we store that in the controller as well in a struct FRTSGameDifficulty together with the provided
difficulty percentage from the UW_FactionDifficultyPicker.
make sure the initialzied bool is also true on that struct.
Then we remove the difficulty picker from the viewport.

4. make sure the controller also a TSubclassOf UW_FactionWorldGenerationSettings that will be a new widget you need to create that has bind widgets for
a button called M_Back
a button called M_Generate
a checkmark M_ShowAdvancedSettings by default false.
a horizontal box M_ExtraDifficultyBox 
a checkmark M_ExtaDifficulty
a horizontal box M_PersonalityBox
a ComboBoxString M_PersonalityComboBox 
a M_DifficultyText rich text block.
a M_SeedSlider going from zero to max int32.

make sure this Personality comb box will display the values of EEnemyWorldPersonality and by default will be disabled/grayed out to
be stuck at EEnemyWorldPersonality::Balanced (functionality to unlock this comes later)
make sure that when the  M_ShowAdvancedSettings is checked that then
the M_ExtraDifficultyBox and M_PersonalityBox are set to visible otherwise hidden (idem for their children)

if the player clicks the back button make sure to notify the controller and then the controller will remove this widget from the viewport and re add the UW_FactionDifficultyPicker to the viewport.
then after picking a new difficulty we will come back to this world generation settings widget.

make sure that the difficulty elected is show with armor rich text tags using FRTSRichTextConverter. the text needs to be:
Difficulty: [difficulty picked]

once the player hits generate build  the FCampaignGenerationSettings struct (already existing in GameInstCampaignGenerationSettings.h)
with the picked seed and if picked the extra difficulty bool and the personality enum ( if not picked it will be Balanced by default)
and provide this back to the controller.
the controller will then store these settings in the URTSGameInstance.
it will then also store the picked faction in URTSGameInstance as well as the picked difficulty struct.
finally it will load the M_CampaignWorld.


you need to design the interaction between the world player controller, the world generator campaign and the game instance.

now for
