what needs to be saved.

- player faction
- player rank.
- player current xp. (we calculate needed and therefore percentage based on the next rank xp threshold)
- player unspent perk points.
- Player perk progress per perk bar.
- list of player unlocked technologies.
- player worldmap resources
- Player Profile card data.



The safe, common solution
Flatten the profile into a pure data snapshot (USTRUCT) and store that inside the campaign save.
That gives you exactly what you want:
one campaign save file per campaign
campaign-local “profile” (cards/perks/tech) is stored with that campaign
loading Campaign A always loads Campaign A’s snapshot → fairness guaranteed
Example shape (conceptual):
USaveWorldCampaign
FWorldCampaignState CampaignState
FPlayerProfileSnapshot PlayerSnapshot ✅
Where FPlayerProfileSnapshot contains the same arrays/ints you currently store in USavePlayerProfile:
available cards
selected cards (FCardSaveData)
cards in units / tech
max slots
nomadic layouts
perks, bought tech, currencies, etc.
