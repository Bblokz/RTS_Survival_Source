you need to refactor the current things regarding the keybinding UI.
1. the UW_KeyBindingPopup is not removed from viewport if needed when we exit the key binding menu.
2. implement an extra button on the key binding popup widget (with bind widget) that will unbind the key of the selected
action. (so it can be used for other actions without conflicts)
3. implement a check when the user tries to exit the key binding menu if there are any unbound actions then show the popup widget at the 
at a new switch level that will have a different rich text box M_BindWarningText and two new buttons (all through bind widget)
M_ConfirmExitButton and M_CancelExitButton.
in the text of that switch level indicate which actions are not bound all in <Text_Bad14> </> tags. this switch level will 
be index 2.
