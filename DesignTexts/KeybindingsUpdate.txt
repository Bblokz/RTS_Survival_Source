we  right now have a very basic keybindings system setup with  UW_EscapeMenuKeyBindingEntry and UW_EscapeMenuKeyBindings.
the core idea here of using the inputmapping is good but right now the UI is unsable and we are going to improve it.
In addition to the 	UPROPERTY(EditDefaultsOnly, Category = "KeyBindings")
                   	TSubclassOf<UW_EscapeMenuKeyBindingEntry> M_KeyBindingEntryClass;
add a new widget class in the same dir the other key binding related widgets are created called
W_KeyBindingPopup which will be a popup widget show when the user clicks on a specific button in our keybindings menu.
this pop up widget will itself have a UW_EscapeMenuKeyBindingEntry that is populated dynamically depending on the special buttons clicked in our
keybindigns menu; more on these special buttosn later. Make sure that this popup widget has a widget switcher where you can assume that
in 0 i put the entry for binding and in 1 i put a richtext block that you populate when the user tries to bind a key that is already taken by
another action.

we keep the original populated list of keybindings with keybing entries; but make sure their box is a scroll box and make sure there is a search bar
 called M_SearchKeyBar which is also bindwidget; i will place the bar above the scroll box and place the scroll box on the left side of the menu (let me do that
 in blueprints you just adjust the backend of things here)
 Note the keybindingentries in that scrollbox should still function like before; that means that actionbuttons and control groups can also be adjusted through that list.
 
 make sure the searchbar works for sorting the keybinding entries in the scrollbar using their action name text; trying to loosely match
 what is typed in the bar.
 
also i want a change in how we display the M_ActionNameText; make sure to remove "IA_" if the action name starts with that.



we need to add 15 buttons to the bind widgets of the UW_EscapeMenuKeyBindingEntry these will each be associated with 
an action button; call them M_ActionButton1 through M_ActionButton15. Now when the player clicks one of these we bring up the 
pop up widget which will be called W_KeyBindingPopup; we will create an instance of this widget dynamically and add it to the viewport or remove ti when needed.
in there populate the keybindingsentry depending on the clicked action button.
IMPORTANT: because the action buttons bindings are also shown in the list of keybindings make sure that when an action button is changed
through the popup the list of keybindings is also updated to reflect that change.

we also need 10 buttons for control groups call them M_ControlGroupButton1 through M_ControlGroupButton10
when these are clicked also use the W_KeyBindingPopup to show the keybinding entry for that control group
IMPORTANT: because the control group bindings are also shown in the list of keybindings make sure that when a control group button is changed
through the popup the list of keybindings is also updated to reflect that change.

In addition make sure there is a checker that makes sure that no two action buttons or control groups can have the same keybinding.
if there is a collision show the pop up with index 1 and populate the rich text block with cannot set keybinding, key already taken by <colliding action>
make sure to use <Text_Bad14> </> around it.
make sure there is an UnderstoodButton in the popup to close it when this message is shown.
