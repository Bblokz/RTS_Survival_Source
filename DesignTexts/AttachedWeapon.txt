you need to implement a new type of component called AttachedWeaponAbilityComponent
it will be identified with the a new Eability Id called IdAttachedWeapon
this component will use mechanics a bit similar to the Aimability component where it will use the player 
aim aimability on the second action button click to aim this weapon but instead of relying on weapons already mounted by a tank
or aircraft (this component will not be implemented for squad controllers) it will setup a new weapon using either
a mesh as provided by the blueprint that has this component added calling the initWithExistingMesh funtion with a mesh 
of that bluerpint on this component 
OR it will have the component spawn a new weapon mesh that will serve as the weapon mesh.

The component needs to Implement IWeaponOwner so the weapon that is spawned can treat it as one.
the weapons are then spawned through the bp callable Setup functions from IWeaponOwner (note: it must be possible to setup multiple
weapons with the same component!)
