Team weapons in my game will be a separate actor derived from
AEmbeddedTurretsMaster so they can get a controller for if they need to have movement too.
With this design document i will layout the requirements needed for the team weapons in my game. Team weapons for mortars,
mgs and at guns; we will start with the at gun first.
currently the game only has 'regular' squads which have a squad controller that issues order to squad units.
the main difference with team weapons will be that they have an extra team weapon pawn which can require setting
up deployment by a few of the squad members before it can fire.

look through the squad controller code and derive a new TeamWeaponController from it.
 the team weapon pawn needs to have a few configs, put these in a struct so it is easy to expand upon later:
 - a yaw setting that defines the min and max yaw for the arc the weapon can reach; if it is zero the
 weapon can turn the full 360 degrees this will be set on the embedded turrets master ; make sure that the embedded turret respects the limits. 
 - it needs to include from weapon owner like the infantry weapon does and support all the setups for
 different weapon types.
 - it needs a setting for DeploymentTime this is a float and determines how long it takes for the weapon to 
 be ready to fire after being placed.
 - the squad needs to wait the same time when they want to move and the weapon needs to be undeployed.
 - a setting that defines how many of the squad units will be direct operators of the team weapon; the other squad units will just
 be defending the squad but not deploying or operating the team weapon.

Define the general logic for squads using team weapons in the TeamWeaponController but define another controller from that
for at weapons, called CarriedAtSquadController
so it is the same for the team weapon pawn; define a general one and derive from  that the
CarriedAtWeapon class.

make sure the weapon is fully functional and that the place and pick up logic works well.
make sure that the weapon will only trigger the underlaying uweapon state to fire if the current target is within the arc
that the weapon can reach.
make sure only player actions of moving the squad can turn the weapon; if a current target is not within reach then
search for a new one (see the infantry weapon later for how to implement a weapon owner) in this case the TeamWeaponController
will be the weapon owner; that logic is directed from the squad.

make sure that the n squad units operating the team weapon cannot use their regular weapon (hide their main weapon)
while they are operating the weapon.
as you can see the squad controller has a function that is called when a squad unit dies; override this in the team weapon squad
to drive the logic of updating who controls the team weapon; when a contorller dies he needs to be replaced and 
when enough infantry died so we can no longer 
operate this weapon; then the weapon will be left vacant.
