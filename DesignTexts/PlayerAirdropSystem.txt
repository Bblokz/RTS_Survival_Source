you will implement a new type of aircraft based on AAircraft master called SupplyDropAircraft

on a high level: this aircraft will be moved to a certain location and then use Vertical landing to land add a certain point below it,
async spawn the actor classes set on it to spawn, using the RTS Functionlibrary static FVector GetLocationProjected to find those locations
near the landing point of the aircraft. then it will wait a certain time, then take off vertically and enter dormancy.

this aircraft will at begin play be set to not be selectable.
 
 for the airdropping it will have a bp friendly struct with the followign settings:
 tarray of actor soft class ptrs to spawn with each array element having a soft class ptr and a float from 0 to 1 for the chance to spawn that actor.
 if set to one it will have a high chance to spawn, if set to 0 it will never spawn.
an int32 of the number of actors to spawn.
 float min spawn offset
 float max spanw offset
float time to wait on ground before takeoff
a sound base ptr, attenuation and concurency for the sound to play when a single drop off supply is placed.
float MinTimeForDropOffItem
float MaxTimeForDropOffItem
float TimeBetweenDropOffs.
   
for the vto speed and such it relys on the settings in the base aircraft class.

it will have a public function called StartAirdropMission that will be bp callable and will take
a start vector , a start FRotator , a land location vector, an int32 of the amount of actors to spawn, and a tarray of actor soft class ptrs to spawn with their float
for the spawnchance probabily mass.

how you have to implement this: first call SetAircraftActive (there is also a SetAircraftDormant) then set the aircraft position to the start location and with
the start rotation. then start vertical landing to the land location. ( you can assume they only differ in Z axis; so we do not have to adjust in x or y)
one the vertical landing is complete pick a class to spawn exactly the amount of actors to spawn times. for each pick do a random float
between 0 and 1 and see which class it falls into based on the spawn chance probability mass tarray. after it is async loaded start a one shot timer between
min and max time for drop off item to spawn it. then wait TImeBetweenDropOffs and set another one shot timer for the next item to spawn until all are spawned.
after spawning all actors wait the time to wait on ground before takeoff and then start vertical takeoff. (make sure in the doxygen of the struct it is clear
what each setting, in particular each time setting means in relation to the spawning of the items so the designer knows how to configure it)

after the aircraft is fully back up at the place it started make it dormant.

for the dormant state in particular make sure the 	TObjectPtr<USkeletalMeshComponent> M_AircraftMesh; is set to not execute any animations
and make sure the aircraft is completely hidden. make sure the tick on the aircraft and its controller are cmpletely disabled as well.
