you will implement a new type of aircraft based on AAircraft master called SupplyDropAircraft

on a high level: this aircraft will be moved to a certain location and then use Vertical landing to land add a certain point below it,
async spawn the actor classes set on it to spawn, using the RTS Functionlibrary static FVector GetLocationProjected to find those locations
near the landing point of the aircraft. then it will wait a certain time, then take off vertically and enter dormancy.

this aircraft will at begin play be set to not be selectable.
 
 for the airdropping it will have a bp friendly struct with the followign settings:
 tarray of actor soft class ptrs to spawn with each array element having a soft class ptr and a float from 0 to 1 for the chance to spawn that actor.
 if set to one it will have a high chance to spawn, if set to 0 it will never spawn.
an int32 of the number of actors to spawn.
 float min spawn offset
 float max spanw offset
float time to wait on ground before takeoff
   
for the vto speed and such it relys on the settings in the base aircraft class.

it will have a public function called StartAirdropMission that will be bp callable and will take
a start vector , a start FRotator , a land location vector, an int32 of the amount of actors to spawn, and a tarray of actor soft class ptrs to spawn with their float
for the spawnchance probabily mass.

how you have to implement this: first call SetAircraftActive (there is also a SetAircraftDormant) then set the aircraft position to the start location and with
the start rotation. then start vertical landing to the land location. ( you can assume they only differ in Z axis; so we do not have to adjust in x or y)
one the vertical landing is complete pick a class to spawn exactly the amount of actors to spawn times.
