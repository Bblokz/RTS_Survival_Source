 We need a huge refactor for the escape menu settings.
 right now on the cpp side we try to setup part of the UI but i want all of that to be moved to bind widget
 and let the designer add the actual buttons/sliders/checkboxes in the widget blueprint.
 what i do want it things like: we need a drop down so we expect a drop down in the widget blueprint through bind widget but then binding
 the options and handling the selection of the drop down should be done on the cpp side after the widget is loaded.
 
 i also want detailed doxygen above the declarations of the bind widgets to make it clear what the designer shoudl add it with child rich
 text boxes to it for example.
