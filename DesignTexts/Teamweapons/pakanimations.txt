currently there is an issue with the attacking of targets through the attack execute command on the team weapons;
 essentially when the team weapon is not in range the squad units will move closer but the weapon itsefl stays put and stays deployed
 it seems to completely disregard guards and operators;
 make sure that we always pack the weapon before moving and make sure that in the case that the weapon needs to be move closer to the target
 the guards wait until the full squad can move just like with regular movement commands.
 
 another issue is that sometimes the weapon operators are teleported to their location through the landscape this should not happen; make sure
 to use landscape channel traces to find the valid locations and teleport them without moving through the landscape itself.
 
 fix both of these issues and explain your work in chat.
 
 look throug the digin component and how the void ATrackedTankMaster::ExecuteDigIn()
 works and how it updates the tracked tank master when it is dug in. 
 also look through the assault tank which is expected to use an embedded turret (like our team weapon) and how it locks it down when dug in and frees it after.
 i want you to implement the dig in functionality for the team weapon in a similair way. make sure that when digging in the weapon actor can nolonger rotate
 (like the assault tank) and is freed of this after the wall is destroyed or the unit uses undig.
 make sure that the team weapon will only start execute of dig in on the dig in component (cache at post init like always) after it is deployed
 so if it is not deployed at the time of exec the command first let it deploy (wait for montage) and then execute the dig in on the dig in component.
