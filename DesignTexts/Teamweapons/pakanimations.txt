i have started work on a general animation controller called UTeamWeaponAnimationInstance
for which later both paks and mortars will derive their animation instances from.

as you can see i have setup a system where we allow for playing two types of montages;
either on the gun slot or on the legs and wheels slot.
the anim inst is set up with the deployment time to calculate how long montages need to last for packing and deploying.  

the rotation implementation is still missing the ExecuteRotateTowardsCommand and the terminate version of the icommands interace need to be implemented;
if the team weapon is deploying at the time of the rotation command then instantly set it back to packed.
then rotate it using the  M_TurnSpeedYaw also update the positions of the guards accoordingly

because the team weapon is an assault turret (special turret; part of embedded turret) this means that if the
target is out of yaw reach the embedded turret will ask through the interface to rotate base; this means we also need a
setup for rotating that will not trigger a done exe command of a rotation command but an internal rotation.

DO NOT MAKE ANY MISTAKES; double check your implementation for things that are still missing.
Always follow the project's coding standards.
