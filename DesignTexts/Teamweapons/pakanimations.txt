 you are going to implement various functions and constants for new squad data entries and subtypes to be used by the 
 new team weapons derived blueprints.
 
 under
 void UTrainingMenuManager::InitAllGameSquadTrainingOptions()
add new functions (privates) for init all antitankGunTWTrainingOptions, init all mortarTWTrainingOptions, init all flak team weapons data, init all artillery tw training options
and init all machine gunTWTrainingOptions.

we will need separate costs constants in the developer settings for each with the at guns, flak guns, artillery, and the mortar crews also costing
some metal while mg teams only cost radixite.
we need training time constants for them too; for each type of team weapon and also for the various sizes within those;
medium at weapon heavy at weapon etc...

idem for InitAllGameSquadData there we need to call sub functions for the different types of team weapons as well.
we also need to define new constants for their vision radii while the health will be reused from the infantry constants settings.
for the ability arrays :
AntiTankGun : attack, move, stop ,  no ability no ability
		EAbilityID::IdDigIn, EAbilityID::IdRotateTowards, EAbilityID::IdNoAbility, EAbilityID::IdNoAbility,
		EAbilityID::IdAttackGround,
		EAbilityID::IdNoAbility, EAbilityID::IdNoAbility, EAbilityID::IdNoAbility, EAbilityID::IdNoAbility,
		EAbilityID::IdNoAbility
idem for mortars, Idem for artillery, Idem for flak guns and idem for machine gun team weapons.

add the new squad subtypes:
Squad_Ger_PaK38 
Squad_Ger_PaK40
Squad_Rus_Zis_57MM
Squad_Rus_Zis_76MM

for aa team weapons:
Squad_Ger_37mmFlak
Squad_Ger_88mmFlak
Squad_Rus_Bofors
Squad_Rus_KS30_130MM

mortar squads:
Squad_Ger_GrW42_80mm
Squad_Rus_80mm_Mortar
Squad_Rus_120mm_Mortar

artillery squads:
Squad_Ger_LefH18
Squad_Ger_SFH18_150mm
Squad_Ger_Nebelwerfer
Squad_Rus_M1938_122mm


Machine gun squads:
Squad_Ger_LMGSquad (already exists but make sure the card for it exists too) and move its data implementation to the right
setup function for all the game machine gun tw data.
Rus_Squad_Maxim
Rus_Squad_DShK

make sure that for all of these subtypes their squad data entries are defined in the correct
function (depending on their type of team weapon) their display name is added under Global_GetSquadDisplayName where
you need to give them good short names (these are used in the UI)
make sure that the card type (for training the unit) exists.

in addition; make sure that the weapon subtype in EWeaponName exists for the team weapon and that their weapon data is
added in the game state if needed. It is important that we do not reuse weapon types that are already in use by different
units as the icon used in the UI depends on this so for example:
there already exists a Flak36_37MM weapon that is used for buildings but for  the team weapon we need a data entry with te exact same
stats but  a differt enum so we can assign a different image for it;
so under 	// Flak 36 37mm
         	WeaponData.WeaponName = EWeaponName::Flak36_37MM;
         	WeaponData.DamageType = ERTSDamageType::Kinetic;
         	WeaponData.WeaponCalibre = 37;
         	WeaponData.TNTExplosiveGrams = 18.2f;
         	WeaponData.BaseDamage = (DamagePerMM * WeaponData.WeaponCalibre
         		+ WeaponData.TNTExplosiveGrams * DamagePerTNTEquivalentGrams) * FlakCannonBonusDamageFactor;
         	WeaponData.ArmorPen = 45;
         	WeaponData.ArmorPenMaxRange = 31;
         	WeaponData.MagCapacity = 6;
         	WeaponData.ReloadSpeed = 2;
         	WeaponData.BaseCooldown = 0.38f;
         	WeaponData.CooldownFlux = 10;
         	WeaponData.Accuracy = 60;
         	WeaponData.ProjectileMovementSpeed = BaseProjectileSpeed * 0.9f;
         	M_TPlayerWeaponDataHashMap.Add(EWeaponName::Flak36_37MM, WeaponData); add another entry with the new enum for the team weapon.
make sure the display names for all the new weapons are added too.

note that Global_GetWeaponValue is not needed as these are not regular squad weapons.

when you are done the data entries for all the new squad team weapons must exists as well as their weapons
double check that you did not forget any of the above steps for any of the new squad subtypes and their corresponding weapons.
