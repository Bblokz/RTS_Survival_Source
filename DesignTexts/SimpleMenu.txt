I need you to implement a new widget called W_EscapeMenu
in its own dir called EscapeMenu in the GameUI folder.
in there in a separate folder also create the W_EscapeMenuSettings .h and .cpp files also derived from UUserWidget

also add a struct there called FPlayerEscapeMenuSettings in its own file
it will have a derived class ptr to  the escape menu widget and 
it will also have a derived class ptr to the settings menu widget which will be provided
to the excape menu when it is created.
a sound base pointer called open menu sound.
a sound base pointer called close menu sound.
a sound base pointer called OpenSettingsMenuSound.
a sound base pointer called CloseSettingsMenuSound.

add this struct as a uproperty edit defaults, bp read write on the cppcontroller. and add a public
bp callable function called OpenEscapeMenu that will:
1. if the escape menu was not yet created before create it from the class.
2. add it to the viewport with good z order so it goes over the main menu.
3. play the open menu sound if it is set in the struct.
4. pause the game.
make sure there are plenty of private helpers for this in a new struct you will define under the player directory, in its 
own directroy called PlayerEscapeMenuManager and the struct called FPlayerEscapeMenuHelper
also make sure to add a bp callable function called CloseEscapeMenu that will:
1. remove the escape menu from the viewport.
2. not destroy the widget but make sure it is completely dormant and does not interfere with anything.
3. play the close menu sound if it is set in the struct.
4. unpause the game.

in the widget
make sure the cppcontroller is provided right after it is created by the controller.
use bind widget for buttons:
- Resume Game
- Settings
- Archive
- Restart Level
- Exit to Main Menu

now for also bind all the click events to the appropriate functions in the GameUIManager class.
For the resume game: this will simply call the CloseEscapeMenu function on the cppcontroller.

for the settings button: create the settings widget from the clas ptr if it is not yet created.
then add it to the viewport with good z order so it goes over the escape menu.
play the OpenSettingsMenuSound if it is set in the struct.
make sure that the settings widget has a close button that will remove it from the viewport,
play the CloseSettingsMenuSound if it is set in the struct, and then make itself dormant again.
and bring the player back to the escape menu.

for the archive button: this will first call the resume game and then call: 
void UMainGameUI::OnOpenArchive() on the main menu.

finally:
add a protected bp callable function to the cppcontroller that will be called OnHitExscape (how this is called
 will be decided on the blueprint) now when this is called and:
 we have building mode active; make sure the building mode is cancelled.
 if we have an action button active (waiting for second click) cancel that.
 if we have rotation arrow active cancel that.
 finally if none of those are the case then call the OpenEscapeMenu function.
