 you have to add a new eability ID callecd EAbilityID::IdRetreat
 
 you have to add the direct action button logic for it in the cpp controller to activate this ability on all selected squads.
 you have to dervie a new behaviour from the beh UBehaviourSquadMovement called USquadRetreatbehaviour and in it set
 the max walk speed and max acceleration mlultipliers to 1.5f each to make the squad move faster when retreating.
 
 you have to implement the Retreat ability in the icommands :
 the funtion  that adds it to the queue.
 the function that exedcutes it
 the function that terminate it.
 
 it will store an FVector in the queue to use as the retreat location. in the cpp controller action button get the location of the
 hq (the player HQ is cached on the controller) and if vallid use GetLocationProjected  in the RTSFunctionLibrary.
 use projection scale of 2 and set the z bool to true.
 provide this projected location as the reatrea t location to the command for all the selected squads.
 
 here is how i wnat you to implement the execute on the squad controller:
 // first check if the lcoation is not nearly zero if it is call done exe command immediately.
 then apply the retreat behaviour to the squad.
 then impelment a helper so that on all selected squad unit's their selection component we set them to
  not be selectable. in addition look for the function to call on the cpp controller froom the squad controller to 
  make the squad be removed from the selected squads array on the controller.
  
 then move the squad for the eabilty ID retreat.
 
 when the move is finished; first remove the behaviour ( the behaviour has to be set to be permanent btw)
 then call the helper to set the units back to be selectable.
 finally call done exe command.
