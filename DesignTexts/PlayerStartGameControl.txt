 You will have to design a new actor component called UPlayerStartGameControl which will be found by the acppcontroller
 at post init and set into its protected field which is a Object pointer called PlayerStartGameControlComponent.
 it will also init the comp there with a ptr to the acppcontroller
 
 you will also add a new widget class derived from UUserWidget called UStartGameWidget of which a class ptr will be a 
 editdeaults only on the new component.
 
 
 at begin play this component will
-pause the game through the controller.
- disable all camera controls 
-add the UStartGameWidget to the screen. with a high z order.

it will also have a public function called player started game where:
-it will unpause the game
-it will enable camera controls
-it will remove the start game widget from the screen. and destroy it.

on the cpp controller add a proteced ufunction called clicked start game button and in there call the player started game function on the component.
